# :alembic: PerfumeConverter :alembic:

## What is this?
- A very basic python script that allows me to easily convert raw percetages of ingredients for use in perfumery.
- I made this solely for myself.
- Makes hand calculations much more palletable while working on perfume composition.

## How to use it
- Put CSV files into the data directory.
- An example CSV file is given to demonstrate how they should be formatted.
- Call csv file within the program (i.e. EXAMPLE.csv).
- Enter the amount of grams you want your concentrate amount to be (which is usually diluted in EtOH to ~15% in the final fragrance).
- For example, 1.5 grams of concentrate would yield a 10 gram final fragrance.
